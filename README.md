# se3-transformer-qm9-mri-comparison

Repository Description:

This repository contains the code and data for a project investigating the application of the SE(3) Transformer to analyze 3D Brain MRI datasets. The project compares the performance of the SE(3) Transformer with a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) on both the QM9 molecular dataset (as a benchmark) and the Brain MRI dataset. The core challenge addressed is adapting the SE(3) Transformer, typically used for molecular data, to handle the spatial characteristics of volumetric brain images. The repository includes code for data preprocessing (including conversion of MRI data to point clouds), model training, evaluation, and result analysis.
